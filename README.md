# New York Green Cab Analysis

This notebook is the analysis for the New York Green Cab for the month of Spetember. It first builds a classification model to see who are going to tip and then a regression model to see how much will those people tip. I have used Datashader and Bokeh to visualize all the green cab rides to see their patterns.
